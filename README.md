### Football-Scout-Machine
This is a prototype model of a *Rudimentary Football Scout Machine*. 

This model was developed in coordination with 2 members to develop a Multivariate Linear regression model for analysis. 
The 22 independant variables are generated from 100+ hours of gameplay video of every player.

We implement feature engineering techniques to generate 6 playmaking attributes and 2 player valuation attributes based on these 22 player attributes.

The model secures
R-squared     - 97%
Adj R-squared - 82%

Furthermore, we take in basic information from any team manager/scout regarding:
1. Player position requirements,
2. Team Budget,
3. Team playing style and more...


Based on the above details, we have designed software to analyze 7 years of data starting from 2015 - 2020 with 25,000+ data points using Python (NumPy, Pandas) and Tableau dashboard.
